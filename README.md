# Film Suggestions

A random movie generator so that you never have to stare into a wall on Friday night not being able to decide what to watch. I used an external API to get data from Imdb. The API was created by the Movie Database (TMDb). I also implemeted the TMDbLib library for C# that utilizes this API and builds on top of it. 

There are two options for searches: with specifying genres and without. Once received from query, the movie title, plot, year and its genres are displayed.
